# Godot Piano Transcription Helper
A tool to analyze music files by frequencies of every piano key, and display them in nice colours.
.mp3 and .ogg files are supported.
Created on Godot 3.3.2.


### TODO:
- Refactor code
- Add keyboard shortcuts
- Make keys light up
- ~~Add mode that make frequency peaks easier to see~~ done!
- ~~Give user control to displayed dB range~~ done!
- ~~Add temporal smoothing~~ done!
- Make bars freeze in position when playback is paused
- Add option to hide UI and piano keys
- (idea) Make lower frequency magnitudes smaller and higher frequency vice versa, so that it matches human perception better
